## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project provides a series of neural network models and utility functions for processing and analyzing gene expression data, including cell type prediction and gene-peak relationship generation. The code is designed to run on local systems with relatively small memory, and it serves to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
