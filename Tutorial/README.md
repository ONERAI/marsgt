# Description

This project provides a series of neural network models and utility functions for processing and analyzing gene expression data, including cell type prediction and gene-peak relationship generation. The code is designed to run on local systems with relatively small memory, and it serves to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## Instructions
Please download the sample data involved in this code according to the instructions in the README.md file in the Data directory.
